## About Sequel Pro Bundles
Bundles are easy to write using your favourite scripting language and our [reference guide][4]. Have you written a fantastic Sequel Pro Bundle that you want to share? [Let us know][8] so that we can feature it on our website.

### Contribute your own bundle
Simply fork this repo and add any new modules to the __contributed__ folder. Apply any bug fixes to core modules directly to the existing module. In both cases, you would want to submit a pull request to the official repo [/sequelpro/Bundles][9].

We will update the list of contributed bundles on our website as we get time. If you would prefer not to contribute using github you can share your bundle [however you like][8].
